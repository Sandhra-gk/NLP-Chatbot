Case Study 4: 
Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) Based Chatbot using arXiv papers as a Knowledge Base

Overview: 
The explosive growth of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a remarkable technological advancement that has reshaped various fields. The exponential growth of research papers and scientific literature in the field of Natural Language Processing demands efficient methods for retrieving and summarizing information. A chatbot that uses information downloaded from arXiv dataset as a knowledge base can help researchers quickly access and understand relevant papers . 

Data: 
Collection of metadata for 10000  papers related to Natural Language Processing domain downloaded from arxiv. 
Fields: Title  Abstract  Authors

Problem statement:
The objective of this case study is to build a chatbot capable of understanding user queries and providing relevant answers from the arXiv dataset provided.

Expectations:
- For exploring the data Topic Model or any suitable technique can be used
- Large Language Models to be used (Any Suitable LLM)
- Data Science Technique to be used for the chatbot ( Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Programming Tool used ( Python or any suitable language)
- Chatbot performance 
 - Relevance of the paper to the query
 - Quality of the answer as compared to the paper
- Bonus Marks for checking Hallucinations by chatbot.
